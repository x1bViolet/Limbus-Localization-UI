(Regarding code)

`ref struct` instead of `static class` is decorative (`@` with them is decorative too)
`partial` modifier for derived ui element classes is decorative

`Pocket Watch ː Type L` is rich text

`rin()` is `Console.WriteLine()` with logging into "[⇲] Assets Directory\Latest loading.txt"

Comments my be via `#pragma` there (To pay more attention (Decorative i mean))
