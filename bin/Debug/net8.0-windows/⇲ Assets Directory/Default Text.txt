<font="EN/Pretendard/Pretendard-Regular SDF">What the <sprite name="AaCePaBa"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White whale</color></u> was to <sprite name="HeatedGasHarpoon"><color=#ff6100><u>Ahab</u></color>, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.

Aside from those more obvious considerations touching <sprite name="AaCePaBa"><u><color=#b03534>Moby Dick</color></u>, which could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that <b>I</b> almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can <b>I</b> hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself <b>I</b> must, else all these chapters might be naught.

Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title <i>“Lord of the <sprite name="AaCePbBa"><color=#c1d7e2><u>White Elephants</u></color></u>”</i> above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>Snow-White</color></u> quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>Snow-White</color></u> charger; and the great <i>Austrian Empire</i>, <i>Cæsarian</i>, heir to overlording <i>Rome</i>, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White</color></u> man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White</color></u> stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble things—the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of the <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White</color></u> belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>Milk-White</color></u> steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White</color></u> forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>Snow-White</color></u> bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred <sprite name="AaCePbBa"><color=#c1d7e2><u>White Dog</u></color></u> was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White</color></u>, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White</color></u> is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the Vision of <i>St. John</i>, <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White</color></u> robes are given to the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White</color></u> before the great <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White</color></u> throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there <sprite name="AaCePbBb"><u><color=#c1d7e2>White</color></u> like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.
